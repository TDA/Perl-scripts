The program reads the current url path and sets itself up to act accordingly as a calculator / guestbook app. Basic input sanitization is done for the guestbook to prevent attackers from including <script> tags that can execute. Similarly, inputs for calculator is checked to perform valid operations ( ie. division by zero is not allowed).

The calculator front-end has a HTML5 pattern so that only numbers are entered into the fields. And all inputs need to be set before the form is processed.

The cgi script is done in perl and thus lots of text processing opportunity, so I took the liberty of processing the textarea to replace empty spaces, too many newlines, tags etc with other suitable replacements.
